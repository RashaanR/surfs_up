## Summary 

As we can expect the June months have a higher tempature overall than the December months. Although it the  December months are in the 
winter we can see they dont see typical winter tempatures. With the average tempature being 71 and minimum of 56 degrees it makes it a 
perfect place for those wanting a little bit of sunshine at the end of the year. My opionion is that surf and ice cream shop would be
sustainable all year around.
